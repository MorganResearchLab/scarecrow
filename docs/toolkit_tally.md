## scarecrow tally
The `tally` tool processes a FASTQ file or SAM file generated by `reap` to record some metrics on the barcodes identified. The outputs include: `.barcodes.csv`, `.barcode.combinations.csv`, `.mismatches.csv`, `.positions`. *Note, it will not process a FASTQ file generated by `scarecrow sam2fastq` as the sequence header format is different.*

```bash
scarecrow tally --input cDNA.fastq --mismatches 2
```

The `.barcodes.csv` file records at each barcode index the barcode sequence identified and the number of times it is observed.

```bash
Index,Barcode,Count
1,TCATTCGC,52
1,GTCTGCTC,818
1,GTCTCTGC,826
```

The `.barcode.combinations.csv` file records for each combination of barcodes the number of times the combination is observed.

```bash
BarcodeCombination,Count
CTGACTTC_CCTAATCC_GATAGACA,1
CATGTCTC_GTGTTCTA_GCCACATA,1
GCTATCAT_CCGAAGTA_CCGAAGTA,1
```

The `.mismatches.csv` file records the count of barcodes (not reads) with a given number of barcode mismatches.

```bash
BarcodeMismatches,Count
0,2432376
1,87246
```

The `.positions.csv` file records for each barcode index the numnber of barcodes found to start at a given position. For instance, if the barcode is expected at position 78, and jitter = 2, then the start position could be in the range 76-80.

```bash
Index,Position,Count
1,77,18226
1,78,74607
1,79,907167
```
