# Workflow

There are essentially two ways of approaching the pre-processing of data. The first, "expectation approach", is with prior knowledge of the library structure and expected barcode placement(s) along known read(s), as well as knowing the read and location of the UMI and the amplified sequence. The second, "blind approach", is without knowing the expected location(s) of barcode(s).
