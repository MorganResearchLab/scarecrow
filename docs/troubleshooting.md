# Troubleshooting


| Tool | Description | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `seed`| In barcodes.csv output, the file indices sometimes start at 0, sometimes at 1 | The FASTQ files are assigned indices before the output is generated. If no barcodes are matched for a FASTQ file then its index will not be returned in the barcodes.csv output. Note this will also be evident in the files generated by `harvest`. |
| `reap`  | Log outputs "Importing pickle" more times than the number of threads requested | This is potentially a memory issue triggering restarts. Either reduce number of threads or increase memory resources |
| `reap`  | Appears to stall and there are too few 'chunks' in the `--out` folder for the requested number of threads | This is likely a memory issue, increase memory resources |
